/**
 * client picks a random known host
 * (1) sends a BeginGossip with its most recent hash of its endpoint set along with a handful of recent endpoints learned about
 * (2) server seeing BeginGossip will
 * (a) integrate the recent endpoints
 * (b) look the provided hash within the HashSetChain
 * (i) if the Set was found within the server's HashSetChain
 * (x) send client a HashFound with the counters and a recent set of endpoints  (completed exchange)
 * (y) the client will then integrate the counters for the Set used
 * (z) the client will integrate the recent endpoints if there are any
 * (w) the client will then send a QuickGossip to complete the exchange
 * (ii) if the Set was not found
 * (x) send client a HashNotFoundReverseConversation with the most recent hash serer knows about along with recent endpoints
 * (y) the client will integrate the recent endpoints if there are any
 * (z) the client will search its HashSetChain for the hash
 * (u) if the Set was found within the client's HashSetChain, then send a ReverseHashFound (completed exchange)
 * (v) if the Set was not found, then send a SlowGossip and stop (breaking asymmetry)
